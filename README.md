Time to write some more code!

<span>Overview</span><br>
In this JavaScript debrief, we’ll provide you with two types of challenges, Start with Challenge 1 and then move on to challenge 2. You’ll have about 40 minutes to work on these coding challenges together.  

<span>Goals</span><br>
1.Inside your Dev directory, create a new directory and call it javaScript_coding_challenges.<br>
2.cd inside javaScript_coding_challenges and create an index.html file.<br>
3.Either use code . to open up the VS code or you can manually open VS code and choose javaScript_coding_challenges to open up.<br>
4.In index.html, get the boilerplate by pressing (!)- Emmet abbreviation, change the title to coding_challenges. <br>
5.Create an app.js file and link it to the index.html.<br>
6.In the app.js file write console.log(“connected!”), open up the index.html in chrome, inspect the page and see if your app.js file is connected!
7.Go back to app.js and start to work towards challenges. <br>
8.Make sure you’re indenting your code, using comments whenever necessary. <br>

<span>Challenge 1 </span><br>
Write a program that will ask users to input their favorite number. Depending on the User’s choice, console.log the messages. 
Follow these steps: (Use if/ else if/ else) 
1. Ask the user to input a number and store it in a variable favNum. Please do a quick research on this window.prompt. 
2. If favNum is greater than or equal to 1000, console.log "Woah, that's a big number!"
3. If favNum is greater than or equal to 0, console.log "That's a cool number."
4. If favNum is less than 0, console.log "Negative numbers?! That's just bananas."<br>

BONUS:<br>
1. Instead of using the console. log change to alerts JavaScript Alerts
2. Try inputting a string. What happens? Refactor your code so that when a user inputs a string, you should get a message “Enter a valid integer”

For the next challenge, go to this REPO and follow the instructions from the README.

Happy Coding :)
